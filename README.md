# CSE 340 Class Project by Kolawole Jegede

This project was developed as part of the **CSE 340** course at Brigham Young University - Idaho. The project is a server-side rendered application built using **Node.js**, with **EJS** as the view engine and **PostgreSQL** as the database. It follows the **MVC (Model-View-Controller)** architecture, making it well-organized, maintainable, and scalable.

## Project Features

This project provides a fully functional web application with the following features:

- **User Authentication:** Users can sign up, log in, and manage their accounts securely.
- **CRUD Operations:** The app enables Create, Read, Update, and Delete operations on database records, facilitating data interaction for registered users.
- **Messaging Capabilities:** Registered users can send and receive messages within the platform, adding an interactive layer to the application.
- **MVC Architecture:** The project adheres to the MVC design pattern, ensuring a clean separation of concerns and a well-organized codebase.
- **Dynamic Server-Side Rendering:** Built with EJS, the application dynamically renders server-side content for a seamless user experience.

## Technologies Used

- **Node.js** - A powerful JavaScript runtime for server-side development.
- **Express.js** - A robust web application framework for handling routing and middleware.
- **EJS (Embedded JavaScript)** - A templating engine that enables dynamic server-side rendering.
- **PostgreSQL** - A reliable relational database for storing and managing data securely.
- **MVC Architecture** - Used to structure the application effectively.
